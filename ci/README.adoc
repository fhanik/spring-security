== Concourse pipeline

Ensure that you've setup the spring-security target and can login

Pipeline will be visible at

https://ci.spring.io/teams/spring-security/pipelines/spring-security

[source]
----
$ fly -t spring-security login -n spring-security -c https://ci.spring.io
----

The pipeline can be deployed using the following command:

[source]
----
$ fly -t spring-security set-pipeline -p spring-security -c ci/pipeline.yml -l ci/parameters.yml
----

You can log into a container for a specific job, in this case the JDK 10 build

[source]
----
$ fly -t spring-security intercept -j spring-security/build-jdk10
----

NOTE: This assumes that you have credhub integration configured with the appropriate
secrets, once secrets are required.
